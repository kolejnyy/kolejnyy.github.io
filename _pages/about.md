Hi, I'm Krzysztof (Chris), currently pursuing my DPHil degree in Computer Science at the University of Oxford.
If you find your projects similar to mind and would like to exchange ideas, please reach out!

Research interests
======

My research focuses mostly on enhancing the mathematical reasoning skills of existing AI models, and understanding how they achieve their problem-solving skills.
More specifically, I am interested in neural theorem proving viewed as code generation in formal mathematical languages allowing automated verification (mainly Lean),
and investigating alternative representations for mathematical knowledge and statements to aid the construction process.

More broadly, I am also interested in neuro-symbolic AI, combining neural networks with classical algorithms.

Background
======

I finished my Master's Degree in Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Oxford in June 2024, ranked top of the cohort.
My courses covered a wide range of topics, spanning from various machine learning topics (CompVis, GeoDL, GraphRL) and algorithms on the computer science side,
to number theory (algebraic, combinatorial, additive) and Galois theory from maths.

In September 2024, I started working as an ML Engineer at TikTok's recommendation algorithm team, where I stayed for almost 9 months. Afterwards, in May 2025,
I briefly joined an early-stage start-up [Catapult](https://www.catapult.xyz/), building AI assistants able to comprehend users' personal contexts.

Since October 2025, I have been pursuing a DPhil in Computer Science at the University of Oxford, focusing on AI for mathematics.
